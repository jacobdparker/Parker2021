Wish I could actually read this one ...  here's the abstract
Snapshot hyperspectral imaging simultaneously acquires spatial and spectral information about a scene. We report on the first, to our knowledge, all-reflective snapshot hyperspectral imager in the form of a computed tomography imaging spectrometer (CTIS). The reflective design allows for instrument simplicity for applications in the ultraviolet and infrared. To realize a CTIS in a reflective Offner configuration, a reflective two-dimensional computer-generated hologram grating is fabricated on a convex spherical substrate by direct-write electron-beam lithography. Furthermore, a reconfigurable reflective field stop is implemented with a micromirror array to provide high-contrast spatial-spectral filtering, region-of-interest selection, and spatial structure formation.
