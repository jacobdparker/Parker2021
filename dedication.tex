% Dedication

I'd like to dedicate this work to my family.
To my father and mother, Doug and Raydene, who instilled in me the value of education from a very early age, and who supported me every step of the way, for much longer than they should have had to, in every way I can imagine.
Thank you also for teaching me everything I know about enjoying the world and people around me.
Because of you my experience in Bozeman has been filled with friends and adventure, something I will never forget.
To my sister, Nikki, who somehow managed to finish school before me, put up with me through the worst eras of my growth, and has become a source of level headed wisdom and kindness in my life when I struggle to find it myself.
And to my fianc\'e, Emmy. 
You have been by my side during my entire experience at MSU.
Together we have experienced pain and play, made so many great friends, and have grown tremendously together since we met 13 years ago.
Good news is, I think now this means you won't have to marry a student!

Thank you all so much.
This has been a long journey, and it's not over yet.
I love you guys.
